# TODOs

1) get faiss-gpu correct installation path programmed so we can use it from pip installing requirements.txt
2) Set up a warehouse for vectorstores and can easily swap them in and out at cmd line or config file (env/yml?)
3) Mirror Ifrit98 GPT_INDEX repo to pull into DocsGPT
4) Wrap this all in a UI and make it FRIENDLY! (set API key from .env, add UI for directory paths and creating indices to load directly from the UI...)
4) Add all requirements for each module parser (this shit won't work outside of text)
